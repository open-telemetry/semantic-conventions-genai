# google-adk

The Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) is an agent framework. It calls models
through its model layer (e.g. `google-genai`), so it **delegates inference**. It
owns the agent, workflow, tool, memory, and remote-agent operations it runs
directly.

The `RemoteA2aAgent` scenario runs the remote agent under a named
`SequentialAgent` workflow. It records the workflow, the local remote-agent
execution, and the A2A CLIENT request as nested spans. The scenario also verifies
that the remote agent retains its parent workflow as library state at the A2A
call boundary and records that workflow as the CLIENT span's immediate logical
caller. ADK currently marks its A2A integration as experimental.

| Operation | Should be instrumented here | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| inference (`chat`) | No — delegates to the model client (`google-genai`) | ✅ Correctly not emitted |
| invoke_agent (internal) | Yes — agent run | ✅ Implemented |
| invoke_agent (client) | Yes — `RemoteA2aAgent` invokes a remote A2A agent | ✅ Implemented |
| invoke_workflow | Yes — workflow agents (e.g. `SequentialAgent`) | ✅ Implemented |
| execute_tool | Yes — ADK runs the tool | ✅ Implemented |
| memory | Yes — memory service upsert / search | ✅ Implemented |
